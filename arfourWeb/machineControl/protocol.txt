Each command from the controller to the platform has the following form:
(CommandId)(Argument 0)[(Argument n)]
Each block e.g. "(CommandId)" is exactly one byte long and interpreted as a an unsigned integer (0-255).

The following Commands are defined:
    CommandId:1
        Name: Precision Move
        Description: Execute a move for a precise distance.
        Arguments:
            Angle: The angle of moving, mapped to the 0-255 interval [1]
            Distance: Takes up 2 bytes (0-65535), the distance in centimeters to be traveled. 
            Speed: The movement speed mapped unto the 0-255 interval [2].
        Response: 1 for success, 0 for failure (unsigned byte)
    CommandId:2
        Name: Arbitrary Move
        Description: Start moving in the given direction and contrinue untill a different command is received.
        Arguments:
        Angle: The angle of movement, mapped to the 0-255 inteval [1].
            Speed: The movement speed mapped unto the 0-255 interval [2].
        Response: Nonte
    CommandId:3
        Name: Spin
        Description: Turn in place.
        Arguments:
            Angle: The angle between the orientation at start-up and the desired orientation, mapped to the 0-255 inteval [1]. 
        Response: 1 for success, 0 for failure (unsigned byte)
